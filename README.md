Blackbox4Windows shell for windows.

-clodio

   * Added a better tasklist filter so Windows 10 apps work better now(the apps from the store) and no more "microsoft text input" in ur taskbar!
   * I have removed things that i think is unnecessary such as the toolbar, search stuff, drag and drop functions, and other stuff that i deem unnecessary.
   * blackboxbar On the clock, left click + shift opens the volume app and left click + alt opens the wifi available networks ui(Doesnt work on under shell mode)
